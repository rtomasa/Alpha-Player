# Alpha-Player

A port of the powerful audio/video encoding/decoding library FFmpeg to libretro. This core allows playback of a variety of audio and video formats, with a fancy audio visualizer and the ability to do interframe blending for smoother scrolling of non-native framerates.

# Important Note

This is a project based on libretro FFmpeg core used by Retroarch. Since the original core is included inside the main Retroarch project, it is not feasible to directly fork the same. I've reorganized the file and folder structure and performed some code refactoring to allow its isolation into a sepparated new project.

# Author/License

Original Media-Player FFmpeg based project is authored by

* Fabrice Bellard
* FFmpeg team

An fully refactored by

* Rubén Tomás (RTA)

# Original FFmpeg Core Information

# Compilation
just execute `make` or `make DEBUG=1` if you want a more verbose execution

# IMPORTANT NOTE!!!
This core has been modified focusing on Raspberry Pi devices using a development version of RePlay OS, so it is not guarantee that it works in other systems or platforms (Linux only).
